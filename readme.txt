Tradify

Tradify is a Python script that uses the Alpaca API to implement a trading bot. It uses the Random Forest algorithm of machine learning to predict stock price trends and execute trades accordingly.

Features
Uses the Alpaca API to access live and historical stock data
Collects and preprocesses data to extract features for prediction
Uses the Random Forest algorithm to make predictions and execute trades
Can trade both live and paper accounts
Trades automatically without human intervention
Can be customized to trade different stocks and cryptocurrencies

Requirements
Python 3.x
Alpaca API credentials (Secret key and Public key)

Usage
Install the required packages:

pip install alpaca_trade_api numpy scikit-learn

Replace the SEC_KEY and PUB_KEY variables with your Alpaca API credentials.

Modify the symb variable to the stock or cryptocurrency you want to trade.

Run the script using the command:

tradify.py

The bot will start trading automatically.

How it is Unique
Tradify is unique because of its Random Forest machine learning model that can predict stock price trends. This model is trained on historical stock data and can make accurate predictions for live trading. It can access both live and historical stock data, which makes it more reliable and accurate. The bot can be used to trade different stocks and cryptocurrencies, and it can also trade on both live and paper accounts.

How it will Revolutionize Banking
Tradify has the potential to revolutionize banking by providing a reliable and automated way of trading stocks and cryptocurrencies. With its Random Forest machine learning model, it can predict price trends accurately and execute trades automatically. This can reduce the risk of human error in trading and make trading more efficient. The bot can also be used by banks and financial institutions to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies on behalf of their clients. This can provide a new revenue stream for banks and financial institutions and make trading more accessible to the general public.

MockBot
MockBot is a simulated version of the trading bot that uses randomly generated market data to demonstrate the functionality of the trading algorithm. The code uses the same algorithm as the live trading bot and performs the same data preprocessing, feature extraction, label generation, and prediction using a trained RandomForestClassifier model.

The purpose of MockBot is to allow the user to test the trading algorithm and understand how it works without actually risking any money. The simulated market data allows the user to observe the trading decisions made by the algorithm and see the results of those decisions without any real-world consequences.

To run MockBot, simply execute the code provided. The simulated market data is generated at the beginning of the code, and the trading algorithm is executed on this data. The output displays the trading decisions made by the algorithm and the prices at which the bot buys and sells the stock.

MockBot demonstrates the versatility of the trading algorithm, showing how it can be applied to any market data, regardless of its source. This feature makes the trading algorithm highly adaptable and opens up new opportunities for investment in a wide range of markets.

Overall, the addition of MockBot to the codebase enhances the functionality of the trading algorithm and provides users with a valuable tool for testing and experimentation.
